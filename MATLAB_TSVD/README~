To be able test Truncated SVD, perform following steps:

Step 1. Run first Matlab program

Precomputed_Inverse_Scattering_Solution_M.m

which uses conventional SVD in order to generate data an matrices U, Sigma, V.

 The program is located  in the directory

M_Calculation/


Step 2. Then for  obtaining reconstructions with reg. parameter 1 use the program

ImageWraper_TimeSeries.m

located in 

TimeSteps_Images/

This program is used in the paper
M. G. Aram, L. Beilina, H. Dobsicek Trefna, , Microwave Thermometry with Potential Application in Non-invasive Monitoring of Hyperthermia, Journal of Inverse and Ill-posed problems, 2020


Step 3. To obtain reconstructions using TSVD (truncated SVD) use the following programs:

a) plotsTikhv2.m

This program generates images of residuals for d_i, i=1,2,3,4,5, and reg.terms depending on the reg.parameter taken on the interval [10^{-14}, 10^3]

The program
plotsTSVDResiduals.m

computes residuals for d_i, i=1,2,3,4,5, and reg.terms depending on the reg.parameter taken on the interval [10^{-14}, 10^3] for TSVD with k=9 in TSVD.

b)  plotsTSVD.m ---> bara for lambda=0

This program generates images of the residual for rhs  d_i, i=1,2,3,4,5, depending on the truncated value in TSVD. In this program the reg.parameter lambda=0

c) plotsTSVDlambda.m

Similar program to plotsTSVD.m  which produces plots for residual,
Tikhonov's functional and reg.term for different truncated values k in TSVD.

In this program one can choose value of reg.parameter lambda and compute residual. We take k=136 as final truncated value here. 

c) plots.m, plotsv2.m

located in

TimeSteps_Images

These programs generate different images and are
produced by Leon and Daniel. Can be used for producing of figures.

d) Image_TSVD.m

This program computes reconstructions using TSVD and different values of reg.parameter lambda and truncated values of k. Use the results of the program
plotsTSVDlambda.m  to analyze which one reconstruction is the best one.

e)  tsvd_analysis.m

This program computes  error estimates obtained in the Theorem.
Can be used for analysis of choosing optimal lambda for reconstructions.
